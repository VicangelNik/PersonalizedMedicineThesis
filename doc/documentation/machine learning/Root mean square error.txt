Root mean square error - measure of the differences between values (sample and population
values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed. It represents
the sample standard deviation of the differences between predicted values and observed values. It
aggregates the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various times into a single measure of
predictive power. It is a good measure of accuracy, but only to compare forecasting errors of
different models for a particular variable and not between variables, as it is scale-dependent. It is
also called the root-mean square deviation, RMSD
The RMSD of predicted values for times t of a regression's dependent variable is computed
for n different predictions as the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations
From httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRoot-mean-square_deviation
Difference between relative and absolute - Absolute error is how much your result deviates from
the real value. Relative error is a measure in percent compared to the real value.
