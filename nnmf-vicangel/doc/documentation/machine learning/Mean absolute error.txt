Mean absolute error â€“ quantity used to measure how close forecasts or predictions are to the
eventual outcomes.
The mean absolute error is given by
As the name suggests, the mean absolute error is an average of the absolute
errors , where is the prediction and the true value. Note that
alternative formulations may include relative frequencies as weight factors.
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error
The mean absolute error is like the variance, but rather than square the difference, use its
absolute value. (If the scores are spread closely around the mean, the variance will be smaller
than the mean absolute error. If the scores are not spread closely, squaring the distance will lead
to larger variances. Taking the absolute value assigns equal weight to the spread of data whereas
squaring emphasizes the extremes. Squaring, however, makes the algebra easier to work with
and relates to Pythagorean Theorem.)
