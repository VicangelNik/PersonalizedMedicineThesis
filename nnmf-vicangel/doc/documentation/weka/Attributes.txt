numeric:
This type of attribute represents a floating-point number.
nominal:
This type of attribute represents a fixed set of nominal values.
string:
This type of attribute represents a dynamically expanding set of nominal values. Usually used in text classification.
date:
This type of attribute represents a date, internally represented as floating-point number storing the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. The string representation of the date must be ISO-8601 compliant, the default is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.
relational:
This type of attribute can contain other attributes and is, e.g., used for representing Multi-Instance data. (Multi-Instance data consists of a nominal attribute containing the bag-id, then a relational attribute with all the attributes of the bag, and finally the class attribute.)
