TP Rate: rate of true positives (instances correctly classified as a given class)

FP Rate: rate of false positives (instances falsely classified as a given class)

Precision: proportion of instances that are truly of a class divided by the total instances classified as that class

Recall: proportion of instances classified as a given class divided by the actual total in that class (equivalent to TP rate)

F-Measure: A combined measure for precision and recall calculated as 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

MCC is used in machine learning as a measure of the quality of binary (two-class) classifications. It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes

ROC( Receiver Operating Characteristics) area measurement: One of the most important values output by Weka. They give you an idea of how the classifiers are performing in general

PRC( Precision Recall) area :

The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets
